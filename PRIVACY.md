Poet Assistant Privacy Policy
=============================

Poet Assistant does not communicate at all with any remote server.

Some data is saved locally to the device:
* When you search for words, they are added to a local database of words to be suggested to you for future searches. You can clear this database at any time by choosing "Clear search history" from the search suggestions. You can also disable the storing of search terms in the settings.
* When you type a poem, it is saved to document called "poem.txt" which you can access from the Files app. This is to preserve the poem, so that it will be present when you leave the app and come back to it later.

You can explicitly choose to use other apps to share the poem, when you tap on the share icon from the Composer tab.
