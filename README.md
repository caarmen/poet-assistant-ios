# Poet Assistant iOS

Poet Assistant is an iOS app which offers a set of tools to help with writing poems:

* a rhyming dictionary, using the Carnegie Mellon University pronunciation dictionary.
* a thesaurus, using the WordNet thesaurus.
* a dictionary, using the WordNet dictionary.
* a screen where you can enter your poem text, and have it read aloud back to you by the device's text-to-speech engine.

The app was initially made for Android. The source code for that project is also on github: [https://github.com/caarmen/poet-assistant](https://github.com/caarmen/poet-assistant)

The iOS app doesn't yet have all the features of the Android app.

These are all the screens so far:

## Todo list
Many features aren't available yet on iOS (they're on Android). This is probably the order in which I'll start to add them:
* ~~Word count in the composer tab~~
* ~~Show recently searched words when opening the search screen~~
* Save the poem to a file, open a text file.
* Star favorite words
* Random word
* Words of the day: list and system notification
* Settings:
  - voice selection, speed, and pitch
  - some tweaks for rhyming rules, to take into account different accents
  - thesaurus reverse lookup
  - dark theme

I also may have to do some UI improvements, including possibly adjusting the design to conform to Apple guidelines...
