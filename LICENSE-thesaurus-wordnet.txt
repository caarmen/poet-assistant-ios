The app uses the WordNet thesaurus.

The WordNet thesaurus is used in LibreOffice and OpenOffice,
in conjunction with other English-language dictionaries and thesauruses.

The version of the WordNet thesaurus used in this thesaurus library is
found in the LibreOffice repository: https://github.com/LibreOffice/dictionaries/tree/master/en
The thesaurus file is th_en_US_v2.dat.

Multiple license files exist in this folder of the LibreOffice repository:
* README.txt contains a BSD license for the Hunspell en_US dictionary
* license.txt contains a GPL v2 license
* WordNet_license.txt contains a specific license from Princeton University.

To the best of my knowledge, the WordNet_license.txt file is the relevant license
for the thesaurus data used in the thesaurus library. The contents of that license are:
